                    As an island group famous for robust centenarians, brutal Second World War battles and the bragging rights of being the healthiest place on earth, an Okinawa itinerary should certainly be considered if you’re travelling in Japan and have the gift of time on your side.  

                    Roughly 400 miles south of mainland Japan and 300 miles north of Taiwan, Okinawa’s isolation has given it the chance to develop a wholly unique culture, away from the norms of the West and in some ways, even Japan itself. 
                    
                    It’s not a big place by any stretch of the imagination, but this one-week Okinawa itinerary leaves no stone unturned and will give you some insight into how to soak up the distinctive Okinawa culture.

The Showa Buddha's head is inlaid with a jeweled crown, a pendant of jade pendants hangs on his chest, and bracelets and arm rings are on his arms. The majestic posture is majestic and breathtaking.
